* [Vision Bonnet Compiler](https://dl.google.com/dl/aiyprojects/vision/bonnet_model_compiler_latest.tgz)

## Object Detection
* [Installing Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md)
* [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
* [Detection Util Scripts](https://github.com/douglasrizzo/detection_util_scripts)
* [Black Cat Detection with AIY](https://cogint.ai/custom-vision-training-on-the-aiy-vision-kit/)
* [Pikachu Detection with AIY](https://github.com/giacomobartoli/vision-kit/tree/master/pikachu-detector)
* [A Walk Through](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html)

#### Tensorflow Models
Because the Vision Bonnet software is based on Tensorflow v1, check out an older branch of the models
```
git clone --single-branch --branch r1.13.0 https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```
