# Resources
* [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
* [Tensorflow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0)
* [Vision Bonnet Compiler](https://dl.google.com/dl/aiyprojects/vision/bonnet_model_compiler_latest.tgz)
* [Installing Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md)

### Tensorflow Models
Because the bonnet is based on Tensorflow v1, check out an older branch of the models
```
git clone --single-branch --branch r1.13.0 https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
